<h1> Digital Transformation of a small business </h1>
<h2>Description of scenario</h2>
Sam’s Scoops is struggling to meet the demand for its products and needs to modernize some areas of the business to keep up. You will combine the skills and knowledge that you applied throughout the course and use them to create a digital transformation expansion plan for them. This will include exploring and suggesting cloud technologies, suggesting additional network devices and creating an extended network diagram.

<h2> Instructions </h2>

- Step 1: Search and find SaaS solutions that will help digitize the business

The first step of this project allowed me to search and suggest SaaS solutions for Sam's scoops to digitize the bussiness. The list below displays several options to modernize and digitize electronic point of sale, accounting, supplier communication and website creation.

- Step 2: Explore and advise Sam on an Azure solution(s)

This step requires to reccomend Azure services to benefit the business, and here are the suggested services with key benefits:

1. Azure Bot: Utilize Azure Bot to collect customer feedback on online purchases. This service aids in assessing business performance and pinpointing areas for improvement in services or products.

2. Azure Analytics: Leverage Azure Analytics to gain insights into customer behaviors and monitor overall business performance. This allows for the analysis of purchase history, enabling targeted offers to specific customers based on their preferences, such as a preferred flavor of ice cream.

3. Azure App Service: Consider using Azure App Service to develop a dedicated Sam’s Scoops app, allowing customers to conveniently place orders directly from their mobile phones.

4. Azure Security Services: Implement Azure Security Services to monitor the network for potential threats. Additionally, this service can be used to securely store business passwords, ensuring a robust and protected authentication system.



- Step 3: Suggest a security device(s)

It is essential to select a device for safeguarding customer data on the company's network. Due to the growing volume of business and customer data on the network, it is imperative to implement a dedicated firewall for Sam’s Scoops. Opting for a next-generation firewall is crucial as it brings enhanced security features, significantly improving the overall protection of Sam’s business. These advanced features enable the firewall to scrutinize data packets for potential threats, effectively preventing various types of attacks from infiltrating the network. Additionally, considering the need for remote access, Sam may also find it beneficial to incorporate VPN connectivity along with the firewall, allowing secure network access from any location.  


- Step 4: Produce a network diagram to present to Sam

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
Through this project, I have successfully outlined a digital transformation expansion plan for Sam's Scoops, a small business seeking to modernize its operations. By suggesting Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, such as electronic point of sale systems, accounting software, supplier communication platforms, and website creation tools, I addressed various aspects of the business that could benefit from digitization. Additionally, I recommended Azure solutions like Azure Bot, Azure Analytics, Azure App Service, and Azure Security Services to further enhance business processes and security measures. Furthermore, I proposed the implementation of a next-generation firewall and VPN connectivity to safeguard customer data and ensure secure remote access to the network. Finally, I created an extended network diagram to visually present the proposed digital transformation initiatives. Overall, this project demonstrates my understanding of cloud technologies and their potential to facilitate business growth and efficiency.
